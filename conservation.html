            <img src="tarsier.png" alt="">
            
            <p> <b><h5>Tarsier</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Appearance</b></p>
            
            <p>The Philippine tarsier has thin, rough fur which is colored gray to dark brown. The narrow tail, usually used for balance, is bald except for a tuft of hair at the end and is about twice the body length. Its elongated "tarsus", or ankle bone, which gives the tarsier its name, allows it to jump at least 3 m from tree to tree. Its long digits are tipped with rounded pads that allow the tarsier to cling easily to trees and grip almost any surface. The thumb is not truly opposable, but the first toe is. All of the digits have flattened nails, except for the second and third toes, which have sharp claws specialized for grooming. Like all tarsiers, the Philippine tarsier's eyes are fixed in its skull; they cannot move in their sockets. Instead, a special adaptation in the neck allows its round head to be rotated 180°. Their eyes are disproportionately large, having the largest eye-to-body weight ratio of all mammals. These huge eyes provide this nocturnal animal with excellent night vision. In bright light, the tarsier's eyes can constrict until the pupil appears to be only a thin spot. In low light or darkness, the pupil can dilate and fill up almost the entire eye. The large membranous ears are mobile, appearing to be almost constantly moving, allowing the tarsier to hear any movement.</p>
    
    
            <p> <b>Where to Find Tarsiers in the Philippines</b></p>
            
            <p>This species is native to the Philippines, where it lives on the islands of Leyte, Samar, Dinagat, Siargao, Bohol, Mindanao, Basilan, and Maripipi. Philippine tarsiers inhabit areas of tall grasses, bamboo shoots, small trees, and bushes in tropical rainforests. They prefer the jungle canopy and leap from limb to limb.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Habits and Lifestyle</b></p>
            
            <p>Philippine tarsiers are nocturnal but are also active at dawn and dusk. During the day they sleep in dense vegetation or sometimes in a hollow tree. At sunset, they begin searching for insect prey. They are agile acrobats, easily leaping vertically from tree to tree. Philippine tarsiers are solitary but may sometimes associate in groups of four animals or fewer. They demonstrate little fear of other species and especially humans unless a quick movement is made. When they are threatened they make a high-pitched squeak. Although less vocal than other primates, a tarsier uses a variety of means of communication, including calls for territorial maintenance and the spacing of males and females. They also use scent marks from glandular secretions to delineate their territories.</p>
    
            <p> <b><h5>Population</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Population threats</b></p>
    
            <p>Tarsiers are under severe threat by trappers and hunters, who shake them out of the trees or chop off the branches of trees where they live. They are also popular as pets, especially in Mexico. However, tarsiers do not often live long in captivity, as being captured traumatizes them so much that they will beat their head against the cage, to the point of killing themselves. These animals are also significantly affected by the increasing deforestation of their native habitat.</p>
            
            <p> <b>Population number</b></p>
            
            <p>According to Primate GCAP Report, the total population size of the Philippine tarsier is less than 2,500 individuals, including 700 tarsiers in Bohol’s Forest. Currently, this species is classified on the IUCN Red List as near threatened (NT) and its numbers continue to decrease.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Ecological niche</b></p>
            
            <p>Being predators, Philippine tarsiers may help to structure insect communities. To the extent that they are preyed upon by other animals, they may impact predator populations.</p>

            <p> <b><h5>Philippine Mouse-Deer</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Appearance</b></p>
            
            <p>The Philippine mouse-deer is a small secretive ruminant native to the Philippines. It has a black and brown coat with white stripes on the throat and chest. Each individual hair has sections of different colors - the base is generally light (ranging from white to ashy brown), with a tawny, orange, or brown midsection, and a long black tip. The most striking markings of the Philippine mouse-deer are on the throat, with three narrow white stripes beginning from a white patch under the chin and extending down towards the chest. Towards the chest, these black and white markings disappear into a broad brown band that crosses the lower throat. The head itself is generally darker in color than the rest of the body. Its slender legs and arched back are covered by brown fur, with a white base.</p>
    
    
            <p> <b>Where to Find Tarsiers in the Philippines</b></p>
            
            <p>Philippine mouse-deer are found in Balabac and nearby smaller islands (Bugsuk and Ramos) southwest of Palawan in the Philippines. They inhabit moist forest, shrubland, and often visit mangroves in order to feed. They have also been spotted along the seashore.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Habits and Lifestyle</b></p>
            
            <p>Philippine mouse-deer are solitary and nocturnal animals. However, sometimes they may occur in pairs for short periods of time. During the day, they typically take shelter in the dense primary and secondary forests and avoid movement. At sundown, they will wander into mangroves and more open areas to feed.</p>
    
            <p> <b><h5>Population</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Population threats</b></p>
    
            <p>The biggest threat to the Philippine mouse-deer is habitat loss. Its native habitat is being converted to agricultural lands for coconut plantations and other crops. The Philippine mouse-deer is also threatened due to poaching and capture for the wild animal trade. Hunting has also caused a great decline in the number of individuals left. The meat is considered a delicacy on the islands, and the skin is also used to make leather.</p>
            
            <p> <b>Population number</b></p>
            
            <p>The IUCN Red List and other sources don’t provide the number of the Philippine mouse-deer total population size. However, in 2006 it was reported that at least 21 free-living individuals occur on Calauit Island. Currently, this species is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List and its numbers today are decreasing.</p>

            <p> <b><h5>Philippine Forest Turtle</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Appearance</b></p>
            
            <p>The Philippine forest turtle is a critically endangered freshwater turtle native to the Philippines. Its plastron is reddish-brown to black in color, sometimes with blotches of yellow. In juveniles, the plastron is a uniform yellow. The bridge (the hinge connecting plastron and carapace) is the same color as the plastron. It is significantly smaller than the carapace and narrow at the front and back. The skin of the legs, body, and neck are rough in appearance, being covered in tiny tubercles. The head is brown in color, sometimes speckled at the temples with light brown, orange, or red spots. A thin white to pale yellow line traverses through the width of the head just behind the openings of the ears, it may be divided at the center in some individuals. This has led to the species being nicknamed the 'bowtie turtle'. The line is more prominent in younger individuals. The upper jaw of this turtle is hooked and the skin on the sides of the neck and the chin are lighter in color. The lower jaw may also sometimes possess a pair of small yellow spots on the sides. The tail is uniformly light brown in color.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Where to Find Tarsiers in the Philippines</b></p>
            
            <p>Philippine forest turtles are known only from northern Palawan and surrounding islands. This includes the island of Dumaran where these turtles are still relatively abundant in creeks. In the areas of Taytay and San Vicente, it is believed their populations are declining sharply. Philippine forest turtles live in the lowland riparian forests in rivers, swamps, and streams.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Habits and Lifestyle</b></p>
            
            <p>Due to their rarity and their status as newly rediscovered, little is known about the lifestyle of Philippine forest turtles. From observations of captive adults, they proved to be very shy and retiring, spending considerable time hiding under rocks, both in and out of the water. They became active in the early morning and late evening, foraging for food and moved about during the night. They were not observed to be keen on basking in the sun, but this may have been the result of being in a captive environment.</p>
    
            <p> <b><h5>Population</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Population threats</b></p>
    
            <p>The Philippine forest turtle is an enigmatic freshwater turtle species, it exerts great fascination for turtle hobbyists. Due to the previous inability to locate it in the wild, the main threats to this species are thought to be habitat loss and potential pressure from collectors. Local Palawan people are known to keep these turtles in water troughs for domestic pigs, as these are supposed to bring luck for the household and the pigs, although it is not known if this luck is shared by the turtles.</p>
            
            <p> <b>Population number</b></p>
            
            <p>The IUCN Red List and other sources don’t provide the number of the Philippine forest turtle total population size. Currently, this species is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List.</p>

            <p> <b><h5>Philippine Crocodile</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Appearance</b></p>
            
            <p>Philippine crocodiles are relatively small reptiles, with broad snouts and thick bony plates on their backs. They have between 66 and 68 teeth which regularly fall out, to be replaced by new ones. Their golden brown color darkens as they grow. This is a fairly small species, reaching breeding maturity at 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) and 15 kg (33 lb) in both sexes. A 69-kilogram (152 lb) individual was found to have a bite force of 2,736 N (615 lbf). Adults rarely exceed 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) and 90 kg (200 lb), and only the largest males attain record maximum size of up to 3.5 m (11 ft), perhaps reaching the maximum weight of 210 kg (460 lb) in exceptional individuals. The females are a little smaller than males.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Where to Find Tarsiers in the Philippines</b></p>
            
            <p>Philippine crocodiles are historically indigenous throughout the islands of the Philippines, including Dalupiri, Luzon, Mindoro, Samar, Jolo, Masbate, Negros, Busuanga and Mindanao. It is now limited to the north of Luzon and the southwest of the Mindanao islands. This species makes its home on estuarine and coastal shores. Most of their habitat is in freshwater areas and may include ponds, marshes and small rivers.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Habits and Lifestyle</b></p>
            
            <p>Philippines crocodiles rest in the sun during the day to warm up. When they are too hot they will open their mouth to release heat. These crocodiles are able to float on the water’s surface. To control their buoyancy they will ingest stones. Not much is known about perception or communication in Philippines crocodiles. In general, crocodilians' skin color changes depending on their mood or the environment. In addition, their bright yellow or orange tongue in their gaping jaw may act as a social or warning sign.</p>
    
            <p> <b><h5>Population</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Population threats</b></p>
    
            <p>The huge population decline of this species in the past was due to excessive hunting for commercial use. Today, destruction of their habitat is the most serious threat to its survival, as rainforests are cleared throughout the region for rice fields to feed the increasing human population. The infamous 'saltwater' or estuarine crocodile, one of the world’s largest, with a reputation for being a man-eater, lives in the same area and undoubtedly contributes to intolerance by locals of any crocodile species, so the small Philippine crocodile is also often killed when encountered.</p>
            
            <p> <b>Population number</b></p>
            
            <p>According to the IUCN Red List, the total Philippine crocodile population size is around 92-137 mature individuals. Currently this species is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) and its numbers today are decreasing.</p>

            <p> <b><h5>Philippine Tamaraw</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Appearance</b></p>
            
            <p>The tamaraw has a compact, heavyset, bovine body, four legs that end in cloven hooves, and a small, horned head at the end of a short neck. It is smaller and stockier compared to the Water buffalo. Adult tamaraw have a dark brown to grayish color. The limbs are short and stocky. White markings are seen in the hooves and the inner lower fore legs. The face is the same color as the body. Most of the members of the species also have a pair of gray-white strips that begin from the inner corner of the eye to the horns. The nose and lips have black skin. The ears are 13.5 cm (5.3 in) long from notch to tip with white markings on the insides. Both sexes grow short, black horns in a V-shaped manner. The horns have flat surfaces and are triangular at their base. Due to the regular rubbing, the tamaraw's horns have a worn outer surface, but with rough inner sides. The horns are reported to be 35.5 to 51.0 cm (14.0 to 20.1 in) long.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Where to Find Tarsiers in the Philippines</b></p>
            
            <p>Tamaraw are found only on the island of Mindoro in the Philippines. They prefer tropical highland forested areas and are usually found in thick brush, near open-canopied glades. Within their mountainous environment, tamaraws will usually be found not far from sources of water. They live in moist areas such as marshes and grasslands.</p>
    
            <p> <b>Habits and Lifestyle</b></p>
            
            <p>Tamaraw are naturally diurnal animals, however, recently they became nocturnal in order to avoid human contact. They are generally solitary and do not occur in herds or smaller packs and are often found alone. Only juveniles may gather in herds and establish a hierarchy. Males and females may associate all year round but this interaction lasts only a few hours. Males are often solitary and apparently aggressive while adult females can be alone, accompanied by a bull, or three young of different ages. Similar to other bovines, tamaraw enjoy mud wallowing; it is thought that this behavior helps the animals to avoid biting insects. Another distinct behavior in tamaraw is their fierceness. When threatened they lower their head and shake their horns. They may also chase one another.</p>
    
            <p> <b><h5>Population</h5></b> </p>
    
            <p> <b>Population threats</b></p>
    
            <p>The biggest threat to tamaraw is habitat loss due to infrastructure development, logging, and agriculture. Hunting for food and sustenance is another serious threat that affects the species' numbers. Tamarw also suffer from poaching and diseases from livestock.</p>
            
            <p> <b>Population number</b></p>
            
            <p>According to the IUCN Red List, the total population size of tamaraw is around 220-300 mature individuals. This species numbers are decreasing and it is currently classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List.</p>
